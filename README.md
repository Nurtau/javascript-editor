# JavaScript Editor
## Overview
* Created an online JavaScript editor which runs the code on the browser.
* Taught myself a transpilation and bundling of JavaScript code.
* Achieved the reduction of bundling process timeby more than 40% by switching from webpack to esbuild.
* Feel free to check it [here](https://javascript-editor.vercel.app/).
* Note: it does not work on Safari browser, I am trying to fix it.
